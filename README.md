# Tree Editor
Graphical editor for node charts.
Nodes can contain any arbitrary data, as well as a list of links to other nodes. Links are represented as lines connecting pairs of nodes.

Nodes can be positioned on screen to organize data. This does not affect the underlying data.

All data can be exported to and from JSON files.

**This is still a work in progress.**
